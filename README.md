# calculator-flat-geometric-figures
My work consists of a small program that runs from the VS Code terminal or Linux Terminal. It was programmed entirely in pure Ruby, because of my experience with that language. It works with flat geometric figures, calculating its area and perimeter, printing the result of the questions on the screen, the history of operations and saving the calculations made in a file with the extension txt, including the name of the operator, observation about the calculation or description of the calculation made that can be manually added by the user, the area of the selected figure, the perimeter and date of operation.
